## PruningMNIST

This deposit contains one notebook which is used to prune a neural network and compare their performances 

# Execution

I used Google Colab to run the code.
Run all the tiles of the notebook (specify TRAIN = True if you don't have the file "model.h5" else TRAIN = False)

# Graph

Once the main exected you get a graph of performances (precision and inference time)
